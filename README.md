# Face-Mask-Detection
Summary: Optimized face mask detection using deep learning models.

This is the final project of Deep Learning and its Application at National Taiwan University in 2022. I co-worked with Pin-Yu Chen, Ching-Hsuan Wei, and Ssu-Hsuan Chen.

•	Tracked effects of different hyperparameter settings on self-constructed Convolutional Neural Networks and pre-trained ResNet models by PyTorch to boost model performance; reached 99.75% F1-score

•	Monitored 32 facial images under diverse self-designed circumstances to test model generalizability and identify weaknesses of classifier by case study; targeted classifier’s over-dependence on covering mouth and nose
